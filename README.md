# UFO_Sightings

The [NATIONAL UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/databank/) maintains an Online repository of all the UFO sightings which is currently limited to state of USA.
There are four types of indexed datasets available :
[Index by EVENT DATE](https://nuforc.org/webreports/ndxevent.html)  
[Index by STATE](https://nuforc.org/webreports/ndxloc.html)  
[Index by SHAPE OF UFO](https://nuforc.org/webreports/ndxshape.html)  
[Index by DATE POSTED](https://nuforc.org/webreports/ndxpost.html)

This is a Hobby Project to get that data and visualize how it looks like :)
